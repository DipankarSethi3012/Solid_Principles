# SOLID Principles Explained with Real-Life Examples

The **SOLID principles** are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming that help developers create software that is easy to maintain, extend, and scale. To make these principles crystal clear, let’s understand them with **real-life examples** instead of code.

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Definition:**  
A class (or module) should have only one reason to change, meaning it should do just one thing.

**Real-Life Example:**  
Think of a **restaurant**.  
- A **chef** cooks food.  
- A **waiter** serves food.  
- A **cashier** handles billing.  

If the chef is also asked to serve food and manage billing, confusion arises, and mistakes are likely. Instead, when each person focuses on a single responsibility, the restaurant runs smoothly.  

**Key Point:**  
Every role or class should have one job only.

## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**Definition:**  
A system should be **open for extension but closed for modification**. You should be able to add new features without changing existing code.

**Real-Life Example:**  
Think of a **power socket board**.  
- The board itself doesn’t need to be modified whenever you buy a new device.  
- You can just plug in a new charger, laptop, or any other device.  

The socket board (existing code) is closed for modification, but it is open for extension since you can add more devices.

**Key Point:**  
Design systems so that you can add features without breaking existing ones.

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**Definition:**  
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without breaking the system.

**Real-Life Example:**  
Consider **transportation modes**:  
- A **car** is a type of vehicle.  
- A **bike** is also a type of vehicle.  

If a system expects a "vehicle," it should work whether you provide a car or a bike. If substituting one breaks the system (for example, if a "bike" suddenly can’t move without fuel like a car), then LSP is violated.

**Key Point:**  
Subtypes should behave consistently with their parent type.

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**Definition:**  
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

**Real-Life Example:**  
Imagine a **remote control**.  
- A TV remote has buttons for power, volume, and channel.  
- An AC remote has buttons for power, temperature, and mode.  

If you create one giant universal remote with **all possible buttons**, many buttons will be irrelevant depending on the device. This makes usage confusing. Instead, different remotes (interfaces) are created for different appliances.

**Key Point:**  
Provide only what is necessary for the client, nothing extra.

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**Definition:**  
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

**Real-Life Example:**  
Think of a **payment system** in an e-commerce app.  
- The app shouldn’t be tightly dependent on PayPal or Stripe directly.  
- Instead, it should rely on a **payment interface**.  

This way, if tomorrow you want to add Google Pay or Apple Pay, you just plug it in without changing the main app logic.

**Key Point:**  
Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

# Final Thoughts

- **SRP:** One role, one responsibility.  
- **OCP:** Add features without modifying existing code.  
- **LSP:** Subtypes should act like their parent type.  
- **ISP:** Don’t force clients to use unnecessary stuff.  
- **DIP:** Depend on abstractions, not details.  

These principles ensure software is **scalable, maintainable, and robust**, just like well-organized systems in real life.
